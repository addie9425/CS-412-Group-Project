Abstract
1. Find a machine learning application that interests you.
2. Find an appropriate dataset for this application.
3. Identify the learning problem: is it classification, clustering or regression?
4. Apply 2 or 3 techniques you learned in the course to solve the problem. You may also try
something new. You are free to use code from any machine learning library.
5. Evaluate each method and compare them. In addition to the accuracy, you may also
compare their training time, inference speeds, and memory consumption.
